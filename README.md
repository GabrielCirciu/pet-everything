# Pet Everything!

## Description

A little idler game that gets crazier and crazier over time. Click on cubes and spheres, then have it automated, and grow your field of basic shapes.

You can increase the amount of spheres and cubes, grow the area they reside on, enable auto-clicking, increase their value, and a few more things, just like the idler games you are used to.

There is no end-goal.

This is a small project I made to evaluate the capabilities of Godot and see how crazy it can get, and how well it handles 3D environments with isometric camera perspectives and many objects on scene with their sizes being modified on a larger scale (if you get that far :) ).

## How to run

I haven't built the project, so to run it, you have to clone the repo.

Upon cloning this repo, you can load up Godot and import the folder as a project.
